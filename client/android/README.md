# ss14xmlproject/client/android

This is the Android client for the "XML Technologien, Sommersemester 2014" course of group 5.

## Building with Eclipse

Requirements (may work with other version, may not):
* Android SDK
* SDK Platform == 19 (via Android SDK Manager)
* Google Play services == 17 (via Android SDK Manager)
* Eclipse == 4.3.2
* Latest ADT plugin for Eclipse 4.3.2 (configured for Android SDK)

Steps required:

1. Start with an empty workspace
2. Click "File" -> "Import" -> "Android" -> "Existing Android Code into Workspace" -> "Next >"
3. Click "Browse"
4. Navigate to "location of your local git clone"/client/android
5. Press "OK"
6. Uncheck "Copy projects into workspace" if it is checked
7. Uncheck "Add project to working sets" if it is checked
8. Press "Finish"

You are now finished importing and can build the client with Eclipse as usual (automatic build should already be enabled, see Eclipse manual / tutorials for information on building projects).
